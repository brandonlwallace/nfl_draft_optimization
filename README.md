# NFL Draft Tool
### Brandon Wallace

This project develops a scraper to collect hundreds of 2023 NFL mock drafts from sports journalists using Scrapy [https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy]. The data are organized and appened in such a way that each row is a mock draft.

The project then develops a drafting tool. NFL teams typically enter the NFL draft with several college football players that they want to join their team. However, the draft is a highly uncertain enviorment. No team has perfect information about the intentions of other teams. Since the draft is ordered, the behavior of the teams preceeding another is studied acutely.

The notebook contains an approah to find a distribution for all players in the draft based on how often they are mocked at each pick. Then, I construct a large simulation. Lastly, I focus on the Pittsburgh Steelers, my favorite team. I find the likelihood that a player the Steelers want is available at their pick location, 17.
