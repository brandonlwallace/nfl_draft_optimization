# NFL Draft Tool
### Brandon Wallace

This project developed a web scraper to collect hundreds of 2023 NFL mock drafts from sports journalists. The data are organized and appeneded in such a way that each row represents a mock draft.

The project then developed a drafting approach. NFL teams typically enter the NFL draft with several college football players in mind that they want to join their team. However, the draft is a highly uncertain enviorment. No team has perfect information about the intentions of other teams. Since the draft is ordered, the behavior of all teams preceeding any given team can be studied.

The notebook contains an approah to find a distribution for all players in the draft based on how often they are mocked at each pick. Then, I construct a large simulation. Lastly, I focus on the Pittsburgh Steelers, my favorite team. I find the likelihood that a player the Steelers want is available at their pick location, 17.
